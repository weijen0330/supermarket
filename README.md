# supermarket

**What language, library, feature, service, or tool does this example demonstrate?**
The supermarket example I created demonstrates Raphael js.

**Why would a web developer want to use this technology? What problem(s) does it solve?
Web developers would want to utilize Raphael if they are looking to
create their own specific chart or image crop and rotate widget. It also makes working with svgs easier.
Personally, I find Raphael much easier to navigate than HTML's canvas element.
One of the things that's most impressive about Raphael is its browser compatibility.
Unlike canvas, Raphael supports all the major browsers including IE6, 7, and 8.

**Why might a web developer be cautious about using this technology?
What limitations, weaknesses, or drawbacks does this technology have?
Does it have an active development community or does it look abandoned?
How many projects seem to use this technology?
If there is a public GitHub repo for this, when was the last commit, how many open issues do they have, and are those issues being addressed?**
I couldn't find a lot of weaknesses on Raphael besides the fact that it doesn't not work on Andriod systems.
However, I find its documentation website really buggy. It would randomly jump around when I was learning the library.
It has a pretty active community with 3,000 topics being discussed on Google Group.
In Raphael's documentation, the links to the public Github repository are broken, so I had to manually navigate myself to Raphael's creator,
Dmitry Baranovskiy's repository. The last commit is about 3 months ago, and there are 308 open issues, but it doesn't seem like they are being addressed.
Plus, there are not a lot of comments on the issues.

**What is your example site/app and how does it demonstrate the value of your chosen technology?**
I chose to design an interactive supermarket map that when the user hovers over a
section, he or she can view the weekly special. It demonstrates the value of Raphael because
a supermarket's layout can differ from store to store, but with Raphael, it can be easily mapped out.

**How should someone run your example? If you have hosted version of your example,
provide a link to it, but also tell us anything we need to know in order to get the example working on our own machines.
If your example requires the installation of tools or frameworks,
explain how to do the install and provide links to any download sites.
If your example requires the execution of commands in the terminal, note those here.
If it requires a local web server in order to work, note that.
If it requires an account on some web service and corresponding keys, provide a link to the service and explain how to configure the keys.**
You don't need anything extra to get my example working.
When you create your own Raphael project, to have it run on your own machine is simple,
just include raphael.js into your HTML in a script tag.
You can download the file on [Raphael's website](http://raphaeljs.com/).

**Where should a web developer go to learn more about this technology? Include links to getting started guides, tutorials, articles, or other examples that you found.**
[Raphael's website](http://raphaeljs.com/) has some fantastic examples so I would start there. My favorites are the [map of Australia](http://raphaeljs.com/australia.html)
and the [shooting game simulator](http://raphaeljs.com/scape/). I just inspect element and taught myself everything.

blog also demonstrates an example of a world map. Stackoverflow is another great place to get questions answered.
